Part 1: Convolutional Neural Network on images

The goal of this part of the project is to use deep Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for object recognition in images. We experimented with different CNN Architectures, to find the best performing model (in terms of accuracy). Using training error and test accuracy as measures of model performance. Training errors are computed using the entropy cost of the training data.
