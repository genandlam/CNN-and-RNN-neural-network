# Overview

This repository was created for a coursework project for Neural Networks (CZ4042) at NTU, Singapore. Our tasks were to study deep neural networks for classification and regression.

Check out Project Description.pdf for more information and Project Report.pdf for details about our apporach and code, our results and some pretty graphs.

## Part 1: Convolutional Neural Network on images (CIFAR-10)

The goal of this part of the project is to use deep Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for object recognition in images. We experimented with different CNN Architectures, to find the best performing model (in terms of accuracy). Using training error and test accuracy as measures of model performance. Training errors are computed using the entropy cost of the training data.

## Part 2: Text classification (Included in folder)

The goal of this part of the project is to experiment with CNN and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) models and with either word or character input. In order to determine the best performing model, test accuracy of each model are taken to obtain the best model. The training errors are computed for all the model using the entropy cost of the training data.
