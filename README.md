# Overview

Part 1: Convolutional Neural Network on images

The goal of this part of the project is to use deep Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for object recognition in images. We experimented with different CNN Architectures, to find the best performing model (in terms of accuracy). Using training error and test accuracy as measures of model performance. Training errors are computed using the entropy cost of the training data.

Part 2: Text classification

The goal of this part of the project is to experiment with CNN and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) models and with either word or character input. In order to determine the best performing model, test accuracy of each model are taken to obtain the best model. The training errors are computed for all the model using the entropy cost of the training data.
